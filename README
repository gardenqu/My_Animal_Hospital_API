My Animal Hospital 

My Animal Hospital is an API that displays various data dealing with a veterinary hospital. It was designed with the front office workers in mind. Ideally there would be a nice Front end UI that would connect with my API and the user would be able to get Client information, Patient and appointment records, and various other things.This is still a work in progress and I will comeback to fully complete it once I learn more about REST APIs and how to host them. 

| Path                | Description |
| -----------         | ----------- |
| /clients            | A GET endpoint     |
| /clients/<id pram>  | A GET endpoint     |
